description: Do a pull request review locally
---

When doing a local pull request review:
- Don't create any comments or make any other modifications to the actual pull request on GitHub.
- Start by summarizing the changes.
- Then provide feedback that addresses code quality, test coverage, potential bugs, and everything else you'd normally access while reviewing a PR.
- Give suggestions for improvement as you see fit.
